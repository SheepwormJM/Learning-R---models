# Using a GLMM to model FECs

library(lme4)

fe<-read.table("fake_eggs.txt", header=T)
summary(fe)

names(fe)
[1] "Region" "FEC"    "Season" "Farm"   "Rain" 

# The FEC is the outcome variable (goes on the left of the model equation)
# The Season, Region and Rain are variables, as is the Farm
# However, the Farm (and possibly also the region?) have random effects - could be included in a Mixed effects model.

# To fit a GLM using MASS:

> library(MASS)
> 
> nb1<- glm.nb(FEC~Season, data=fe)
> summary(nb1)

# To fit a GLMM for negative binomial data using lme4:

require("MASS")
glmmnb1 <- glmer.nb(FEC ~ Season  + (1|Farm), data=fe)
glmmnb1

# There doesn't seem to be much difference between this and the glm.nb model run with MASS! If anything, it might be worse! 

# Checked fit using DHARMa and very little difference.
